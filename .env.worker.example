# Disable TLS certificate verification for GitHub operations in agent containers (default: false)
# WARNING: Only enable this in networks with TLS-intercepting proxies (e.g. corporate
# environments). This disables certificate validation for git clone/push and GitHub API
# calls made by the agent, making connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
# Do not enable in production unless absolutely necessary.

# Strip anthropic-beta headers from Claude Code CLI API requests (default: false)
# Enable this when using a Bedrock proxy or other API-compatible backend that does
# not support Anthropic beta features. Claude Code CLI sends anthropic-beta headers
# by default, which can cause errors with proxies that reject unknown headers.
# When enabled, the worker runs a local reverse proxy that removes these headers
# before forwarding requests to the Anthropic API (or Bedrock proxy).
